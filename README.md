<h1 align="center"><b>D.S. Project</b>: <i>Machine Translator</i></h1>


---

## Description

A simple Machine Translator that uses Deep Learning to accurately translate bilingual sentence pairs. I chose this project to deepen my understanding of text preprocessing, machine learning pipelines, and building neural networks.

I trained my model using data from [English-French Sentence Pairs](https://www.kaggle.com/zeeshanshaik75/language-translationenglish-to-french/data#), however I plan to expand the model to use with multiple languages and a lot more data.

## Credits

`TODO`: **Replace these statements with your own credits and acknowledgements, or remove this section entirely!**

Thanks to the [Make School](https://makeschool.com/) community of students and professionals seeking to learn software engineering and data science for real-world applications. 

Special thanks to [Alan Davis](https://github.com/neptunius), [Mike Kane](https://github.com/mike-kane), and [Milad Toutounchian](https://github.com/miladtoutounchian) for teaching me modern data science and computer science skills to be able to both teach others and make an impact in the field of applied biology (my own personal domain-of-interest). 

Credits to the [Cookie Cutter project](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for inspiring me to create a similar structural tool for learning and training data science fellows at Make School to formulate better and more enriched projects without wasting too much time on hierarchical setup.
